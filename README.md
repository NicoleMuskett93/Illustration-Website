# Illustration-Website

I created this project to showcase my illustration work. 
I have used HTML, CSS and BootStrap to create my website. 
This project was my first time using a CSS framework and it made me realise how useful they are. It made designing the website so much easier and it was clean and easy to code. 
This is a projec that I could add more to e.g adding an e-commerce to sell my artwork from.
